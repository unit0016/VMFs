Holes in Space!

TTT Holestation's probably the biggest out of my projects; scuffed as it is. It's small; though. Real small.
Originally a space station 13 map made for Horizon - then Monkestation; then Tetrastation13; and finally Effigy;
this is a quarter of Holestation scuffedly shoved into Garry's Mod for goofy TTT action.
