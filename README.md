# VMFs
VMFs for each of my Source maps, to avoid decompiler-introduced distortion for editors.
Take heed, no materials or models are included in order to avoid license issues - you'll still have to extract them from the .gma file yourself.

TTT_Holestation's (And all maps prior to it) VMF has been lost, so you'll have to deal with a decompiler to edit those.
